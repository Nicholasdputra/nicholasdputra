        A cozy diner-dash like game where you play as a barista at a cat cafe. During this project, I designed the game and helped with implementing the randomized customer orders, affection meter, and states.

        Debugged is a tower defense game in which you fight as a defense system trying to squash bugs by switching towers on/off! During the project, I mainly focused on using abstract classes for the different towers and enemies (Solo Programmer).

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
 I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Binus University's Game Development Course. I use Unity to make my games but I'm open to learning other engines!.<br>
 <br>
 Aside from becoming a game programmer, here are some other things I've done:<br>
 - Worked as a game designer on a few projects (sometimes while also being a game programmer)
 - Worked as a mentor and taught less well performing students which has improved my communication skills and patience
 - Worked as a freshman chaperone alongside a group of others which has improved my collaboration and communication skills
